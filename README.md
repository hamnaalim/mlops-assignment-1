# MLOps Assignment 1

This repository contains my work for **MLOps Assignment 1**.  
It demonstrates best practices in:
- GitHub version control
- Project structure
- ML experiment tracking with MLflow
- Model training and comparison

## Project Structure
- `data/` → dataset files (not large raw data)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `src/` → Python source code (training, utilities)
- `models/` → trained models
- `results/` → evaluation metrics, plots
